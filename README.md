# Titanic-Machine-Learning-with-R
One of my goals throughout my career as a student is to learn and deepen both programming and machine learning, from a statistical point of view. In order to get more fully acquainted with those subjects t is essential to practice. For this reason, I tried a beginner-friendly competition, named “Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster”, from @Kaggle with my teammates and friends @Víctor and @Alex. I feel glad to share that we got a rank of 2383 on the competition leaderborad among the 20.000+ submissions as of now. The following R-Notebook contains my part of the submission: Machine Learning Algorithms, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and Accuracy comparison of the used algorithms. It is necessary to emphasize that we are inexperienced in the area, so we still have a lot to learn.  I encourage anyone who wants to learn about this wonderful topic to participate in Kaggle competitions
